I2P-Bote 0.4.5 fixes a security vulnerability present in all earlier versions of the
I2P-Bote plugin. The Android app was not affected.
</p><p>
When showing emails to the user, most fields were being escaped. However, the filenames
of attachments were not escaped, and could be used to execute malicious code in a browser
with JavaScript enabled. These are now escaped, and additionally a Content Security Policy
has been implemented for all pages.
</p><p>
All I2P-Bote users will be upgraded automatically the first time they restart their router
after I2P 0.9.29 is released in mid-February. However, for safety we recommend that you
<a href="http://bote.i2p/install/">follow the instructions on the installation page</a> to
upgrade manually if you plan on using I2P or I2P-Bote in the intervening time.

There are fixes for the IPv6 peer testing feature introduced last release.
We continue improvements to detect and block peers that are potentially malicious.
There are preliminary fixes for Java 9, although we do not yet recommend Java 9 for general use.
</p><p>
I2P will be at 33C3, please stop by our table and give us your ideas on how to improve the network.
We will review our 2017 roadmap and priorities 2017 at the Congress.

<p>
I2P-Bote 0.4.4 fixes a security vulnerability present in all earlier versions of the
I2P-Bote plugin. The Android app was not affected.
</p><p>
A lack of CSRF protection meant that if a user was running I2P-Bote and then loaded a
malicious site in a browser with JavaScript enabled, the adversary could trigger actions
in I2P-Bote on behalf of the user, such as sending messages. This might also have enabled
extraction of private keys for I2P-Bote addresses, however no proof-of-exploit was tested
for this.
</p><p>
All I2P-Bote users will be upgraded automatically the first time they restart their router
after I2P 0.9.28 is released in mid-December. However, for safety we recommend that you
<a href="http://bote.i2p/install/">follow the instructions on the installation page</a> to
upgrade manually if you plan on using I2P or I2P-Bote in the intervening time. You should
also consider generating new I2P-Bote addresses if you regularly browse sites with
JavaScript enabled while running I2P-Bote.

<summary>0.9.26 contains crypto updates, Debian packaging improvements, and bug fixes</summary>
</details>
<p>
0.9.26 contains a major upgrade to our native crypto library,
a new addressbook subscription protocol with signatures,
and major improvements to the Debian/Ubuntu packaging.
</p><p>
For crypto, we have upgraded to GMP 6.0.0, and added support for newer processors,
which will speed up crypto operations considerably.
Also, we are now using constant-time GMP functions to prevent side-channel attacks.
For caution, the GMP changes are enabled for new installs and Debian/Ubuntu builds only;
we will include them for in-net updates in the 0.9.27 release.
</p><p>
For Debian/Ubuntu builds, we have added dependencies on several packages,
including Jetty 8 and geoip, and removed the equivalent bundled code.
</p><p>
There's a collection of bug fixes also, including a fix for a timer bug
that caused instability and performance degradations over time.
As usual, we recommend that all users update to this release.

<p>
0.9.25 contains a major new version of SAM, v3.3, to support sophisticated multiprotocol applications.
It adds QR codes for sharing hidden service addresses with others,
and "identicon" images for visually distinguishing addresses.
</p><p>
We've added a new "router family" configuration page in the console,
to make it easier to declare that your group of routers is run by a single person.
There are several changes to increase the capacity of the network and hopefully improve tunnel build success.

</details>
<p>
0.9.24 contains a new version of SAM (v3.2) and numerous bug fixes and efficiency improvements.
Note that this release is the first to require Java 7.
Please update to Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible.
Your router will not automatically update if you are using Java 6.
</p><p>
To prevent the problems caused by the ancient commons-logging library, we have removed it.
This will cause very old I2P-Bote plugins (0.2.10 and below, signed by HungryHobo) to crash if they have IMAP enabled.
The recommended fix is to replace your old I2P-Bote plugin with the current one signed by str4d.

<summary>0.9.23 contains a variety of bug fixes, and some minor improvements in I2PSnark</summary>
</details>
<p>
Hello I2P! This is the first release signed by me (str4d), after 49 releases
signed by zzz. This is an important test of our redundancy for all things,
including people.
</p>
<p><b>Housekeeping</b></p>
<p>
My signing key has been in router updates for over two years (since 0.9.9), so
if you are on a recent version of I2P this update should be just as easy as
every other update. However, if you are running an older version than 0.9.9, you
will first need to manually update to a recent version. Update files for recent
versions can be downloaded
<a href="http://whnxvjwjhzsske5yevyokhskllvtisv5ueokw6yvh6t7zqrpra2q.b32.i2p/releases/">here</a>,
and instructions on how to manually update are provided
<a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/download#update">here</a>. Once you have manually
updated, your router will then find and download the 0.9.23 update as usual.
</p><p>
If you installed I2P via a package manager, you are not affected by the change,
and can update as usual.
</p>
<p><b>Update details</b></p>
<p>
The migration of RouterInfos to new, stronger Ed25519 signatures is going well,
with at least half of the network already estimated to have rekeyed. This
release accelerates the rekeying process. To reduce network churn, your router
will have a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart. When it
does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it
reintegrates into the network with its new identity.
</p><p>
Note that this will be the last release to support Java 6. Please update to
Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible. We are already working to make I2P compatible
with the upcoming Java 9, and some of that work is in this release.
</p><p>
We have also made some minor improvements in I2PSnark, and added a new page in
the routerconsole for viewing older news items.
</p><p>
As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.

<p>
0.9.22 contains fixes for i2psnark getting stuck before completion, and begins the migration of router infos to new, stronger Ed25519 signatures.
To reduce network churn, your router will have only a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart.
When it does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it reintegrates into the network with its new identity.
If all goes well, we will accelerate the rekeying process in the next release.

0.9.21 contains several changes to add capacity to the network, increase the efficiency of the floodfills,
and use bandwidth more effectively.
We have migrated the shared clients tunnels to ECDSA signatures and added a DSA fallback
using the new "multisession" capability for those sites that don't support ECDSA.
