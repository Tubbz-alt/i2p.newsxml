<summary>0.9.21 released with performance improvements and bug fixes.</summary>
</details>
<p>
0.9.21 contains several changes to add capacity to the network, increase the efficiency of the floodfills,
and use bandwidth more effectively.
We have migrated the shared clients tunnels to ECDSA signatures and added a DSA fallback
using the new "multisession" capability for those sites that don't support ECDSA.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
