<summary>0.9.22 with bug fixes and starts Ed25519 migration</summary>
</details>
<p>
0.9.22 contains fixes for i2psnark getting stuck before completion, and begins the migration of router infos to new, stronger Ed25519 signatures.
To reduce network churn, your router will have only a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart.
When it does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it reintegrates into the network with its new identity.
If all goes well, we will accelerate the rekeying process in the next release.

I2PCon Toronto was a big success!
All the presentations and videos are listed on the <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/about/i2pcon/2015">I2PCon page</a>.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.

<summary>0.9.21 released with performance improvements and bug fixes.</summary>
</details>
<p>
0.9.21 contains several changes to add capacity to the network, increase the efficiency of the floodfills,
and use bandwidth more effectively.
We have migrated the shared clients tunnels to ECDSA signatures and added a DSA fallback
using the new "multisession" capability for those sites that don't support ECDSA.
