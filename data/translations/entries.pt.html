The previous versions are no longer supported, and are not available in the upcoming Debian Stretch and Ubuntu Zesty releases.
The router will migrate the jetty.xml configuration file for each Jetty website to the new Jetty 9 setup.
This should work for recent, unmodified configurations but may not work for modified or very old setups.
Verify that your Jetty website works after upgrading, and contact us on IRC if you need assistance.</p>
<p>Several plugins are not compatible with Jetty 9 and must be updated.
The following plugins have been updated to work with 0.9.30, and your router should update them after restart:
i2pbote 0.4.6; zzzot 0.15.0.
The following plugins (with current versions listed) will not work with 0.9.30.
Contact the appropriate plugin developer for the status of new versions:
BwSchedule 0.0.36; i2pcontrol 0.11.</p>
<p>This release also supports migration of old (2014 and earlier) DSA-SHA1 hidden services to the more-secure EdDSA signature type.
See <a href="http://zzz.i2p/topics/2271">zzz.i2p</a> for further information, including a guide and FAQ.</p>
<p>Note: On non-Android ARM platforms such as the Raspberry Pi, the blockfile database will upgrade on restart, which may take several minutes.
Please be patient.</p>
<p>As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.</p>

<p>A lack of CSRF protection meant that if a user was running I2P-Bote and then loaded a
malicious site in a browser with JavaScript enabled, the adversary could trigger actions
in I2P-Bote on behalf of the user, such as sending messages. This might also have enabled
extraction of private keys for I2P-Bote addresses, however no proof-of-exploit was tested
for this.</p>
<p>All I2P-Bote users will be upgraded automatically the first time they restart their router

a new addressbook subscription protocol with signatures,
and major improvements to the Debian/Ubuntu packaging.</p>
<p>For crypto, we have upgraded to GMP 6.0.0, and added support for newer processors,
which will speed up crypto operations considerably.
Also, we are now using constant-time GMP functions to prevent side-channel attacks.
For caution, the GMP changes are enabled for new installs and Debian/Ubuntu builds only;
we will include them for in-net updates in the 0.9.27 release.</p>
<p>For Debian/Ubuntu builds, we have added dependencies on several packages,
including Jetty 8 and geoip, and removed the equivalent bundled code.</p>
<p>There's a collection of bug fixes also, including a fix for a timer bug
that caused instability and performance degradations over time.

<p>To prevent the problems caused by the ancient commons-logging library, we have removed it.
This will cause very old I2P-Bote plugins (0.2.10 and below, signed by HungryHobo) to crash if they have IMAP enabled.
The recommended fix is to replace your old I2P-Bote plugin with the current one signed by str4d.

This is the first release signed by me (str4d), after 49 releases
signed by zzz. This is an important test of our redundancy for all things,
including people.</p>
<p><b>Limpeza</b></p>
<p>My signing key has been in router updates for over two years (since 0.9.9), so
if you are on a recent version of I2P this update should be just as easy as
every other update. However, if you are running an older version than 0.9.9, you
will first need to manually update to a recent version. Update files for recent
versions can be downloaded
<a href="http://whnxvjwjhzsske5yevyokhskllvtisv5ueokw6yvh6t7zqrpra2q.b32.i2p/releases/">here</a>,
and instructions on how to manually update are provided
<a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/download#update">here</a>. Once you have manually
updated, your router will then find and download the 0.9.23 update as usual.</p>
<p>If you installed I2P via a package manager, you are not affected by the change,
and can update as usual.</p>
<p><b>Detalhes da atualização</b></p>
<p>The migration of RouterInfos to new, stronger Ed25519 signatures is going well,
with at least half of the network already estimated to have rekeyed. This
release accelerates the rekeying process. To reduce network churn, your router
will have a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart. When it
does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it
reintegrates into the network with its new identity.</p>
<p>Note that this will be the last release to support Java 6. Please update to
Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible. We are already working to make I2P compatible
with the upcoming Java 9, and some of that work is in this release.</p>
<p>We have also made some minor improvements in I2PSnark, and added a new page in
the routerconsole for viewing older news items.</p>
<p>As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.</p>

When it does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it reintegrates into the network with its new identity.
If all goes well, we will accelerate the rekeying process in the next release.</p>
