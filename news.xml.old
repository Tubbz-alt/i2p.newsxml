<h3>2011-11-01: <b>0.8.10-5 <a href="http://echelon.i2p/0.8.10/0.8.10-5">dev version</a> available for testing</b></h3>
<p>
Because of changes made in the last release cycle (v0.8.10), performance (such
as tunnel building) on the I2P network has improved &mdash; but not nearly
as much as was hoped. Further tweaks have been made to help with the scaling
issues caused by the recent influx of new users.  Additionally, routers will be
able to become better integrated with the network quicker than was previously
possible.
</p>
<p>
Please help test the latest changes to the code by upgrading to the most
recent <a href="http://echelon.i2p/0.8.10/0.8.10-5">development
build</a>.

<h3>2011-10-20: <b>0.8.10 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.10.html">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
Release 0.8.10 includes two changes intended to reduce the number of router-to-router connections,
and therefore improve tunnel build success rates and general reliability.
Of course, there's also a few bug fixes and translation updates.
</p><p>
The network has grown quite rapidly in recent weeks, and that's great news,
but it has caused some instability. We welcome all our new users and we
ask you to be patient as we make improvements to the software.
