<h3>2013-12-07: <b>0.9.9 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.9.9.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>0.9.9 fixes a number of bugs in the netdb, streaming, and i2ptunnel,
and starts work on a year-long plan to increase the strength
of the cryptographic signing algorithms used in the router, and support multiple algorithms
and key lengths simultaneously. Automatic update files will now be signed with 4096-bit keys.
We now support SSL between your router and your servers for security.
