<h4><ul><li>2010-11-10: <b>forum.i2p up again</b></li></ul></h4>
<p>
The I2P forum <a href="http://forum.i2p">forum.i2p</a> is up again.
</p>
<h4><ul><li>2010-11-06: <b>forum.i2p is down</b></li></ul></h4>
<p>
The link to <a href="http://forum.i2p">forum.i2p</a> is currently down. As a result the forum is only reachable via
<a href="http://forum.i2p2.de">http://www.i2p2.de</a> accross the usual internet connection.<br>
The forum administrator is noticed and will bring up the in-I2P connection as soon as possible. We are sorry for the inconvenience.<br>
<br>
While postmans mailservice was down you surely had a try on <a href="http://i2pbote.i2p/">I2P-Bote</a>, a alternative mail implementation inside of I2P.
