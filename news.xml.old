<h3>2011-06-06: <b>Ipredator Summer of Code</b></h>
<p>
Hottuna has been commissioned to contribute code to I2P during the summer of 2011, implementing 
a control protocol and a client for this protocol (similar to 
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html">Vidalia</a> for Tor).
This work was the idea of Jan-Erik Fiske of <a href="http://viaeuropa.se">ViaEuropa</a> 
and Peter Sunde of <a href="https://flattr.com">flattr</a> and 
<a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay</a> fame and its funding will be generously 
provided by <a href="https://www.relakks.com/?cid=gb">Relakks</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ipredator.se/?lang=en">Ipredator</a>.
