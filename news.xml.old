<h3>2014-02-20: <b>New Bitcoin and Litecoin donation addresses for I2P</b></h3>	
<p>
After a security breach on eche|ons systems we decided to genereate new addresses
for the I2P Bitcoin and Litecoin donations.
The new addresses are already noted on our <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/get-involved/donate">Donate</a>
website. Please do use the new addresses from today on! The old addresses will still be checked 
on a regular base for some time.
</p>
<h3>2014-02-19: <b>false.i2p down for a while</b></h3>
<p>
For private reasons the outproxy false.i2p will be down for some indefinite time.
For a replacement do have a look into <a href="http://forum.i2p">forum.i2p</a> or do use the new
<a href="http://plugins.i2p/plugins/orchid/">orchid</a> plugin, which setups a Java Tor client
into your I2P installation.
</p>
<h3>2014-02-18: <b>Java 6 or Higher Required as of Release 0.9.12</b></h3>
<p>
This is our first increase in the minimum Java requirement since the I2P 0.6.5 release on Dec. 1, 2008.
Java 5 is very old and is unsupported by Oracle and most other suppliers.
If you are still running Java 5, please update to 6 or higher as soon as possible. Java 7 is strongly recommended for most platforms. For Raspberry Pi, we recommend Oracle Early Access 8.

<h3>2014-02-07: <b><a href="http://echelon.i2p/docs/IRC2p/irc2p_userguide.txt">IRC2p Migration</a></b></h3>
<p>
After some work and weeks of preparation, the IRC2p team is ready to switch the operating servers to a new
setup and an upgraded IRCd/services. A new IRC server (irc.dg.i2p) is also joining the network!
The transition will occur on 2014-02-23 between 1:00PM UTC and 4:00PM UTC. During this time, the IRC2P will be
inaccessible and upgraded.
The new setup involves changes that may affect users. Read more about this migration on the
<a href="http://echelon.i2p/docs/IRC2p/irc2p_userguide.txt">IRC2p migration guide</a>.
