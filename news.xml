<h3>2011-10-10: Net growth and soon-to-come update</h3>
<p>
Сердечно приветствую наших новых русскоязычных пользователей! (A warm welcome to our new Russian users!)

Due to rusleaks we've recently been experiencing a massive influx of many new routers.
We have now hit the mark of 10,000 and later even the one of 12,000 active routers.
This is currently making the ride a bit bumpy, but all is fine.
This means a growth of the network, which comes accompanied by some growing pains, but it's nothing to worry about.
Generally, growth is good for the network and good for your anonymity.
So if you are having problems accessing some services, be patient.
Not all eepsites are currently reachable on first attempt, but we hope that will level out soon.
So again, be patient, don't leave straight away, and stay tuned for the soon-to-come I2P router update!
</p>
<h3>2011-08-23: <b>0.8.8 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.8.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>I2P release 0.8.8 enables the new hosts.txt database to speed hostname lookups
 and store additional information on hostname entries.
 It also includes improvements to speed a router's integration on startup.
 There is new code to detect and react to large clock shifts that should help
 a router recover after suspend/resume of the computer.
</p><p>
 There are new translations for Danish and Ukranian and lots of updates in other languages.
 Also included are, of course, a large collection of bug fixes, performance improvements,
 and updates to deal with the continued rapid expansion of the network.

</p><p>
Please help grow the network.
