<h3>2011-11-01: <b>0.8.10-5 <a href="http://echelon.i2p/0.8.10/0.8.10-5">dev version</a> for testing</b></h3>
<p>
As the last version 0.8.10 has shown some effect on network health and better tunnel built rates, it did not show as much
effect as we hoped. Our effort has gone on and some more tweaks, bugfixes and changes were integrated.
We are confident this latest development beta built shows more effect and will help I2P router to integrate better
into the I2P net in shorter time. We encourage our I2P users to test this development built!

<h3>2011-10-20: <b>0.8.10 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.10.html">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
Release 0.8.10 includes two changes intended to reduce the number of router-to-router connections,
and therefore improve tunnel build success rates and general reliability.
Of course, there's also a few bug fixes and translation updates.

The network has grown quite rapidly in recent weeks, and that's great news,
but it has caused some instability. We welcome all our new users and we
ask you to be patient as we make improvements to the software.
