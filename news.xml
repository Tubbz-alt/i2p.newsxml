<h3>2011-10-17: Recent net growth and pledge to keep router running</h3>
<p>
Due to rusleaks we have recently been experiencing a massive influx of many new routers to I2P and have reached a mark of 12,000 active routers.
This makes the ride a bit bumpy currently, but nothing to worry about. Generally, growth is good for the network and good for your anonymity.
Not all eepsites are currently reachable on first attempt, but we hope that will level out soon.
So, if you are having problems accessing some services, be patient and don't leave straight away!
Leave your I2P router running even when you're not actually using it - ideally run it 24/7!
This helps the network and is good for your own anonymity.
Make sure you're not firewalled and have adjusted your bandwidth settings accordingly.
Performance will then improve with these simple steps of yours.

In the meantime you maybe want to try out <a href="http://echelon.i2p/i2phex">I2Phex</a>,
<a href="http://echelon.i2p/imule">iMule</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2psnark/">I2Psnark</a> to make use of the running I2P router?

<h3>2011-10-11: <b>0.8.9 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.9.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>
The 0.8.9 release has several performance improvements, and many changes to handle
the continued rapid growth of the network. It uses a new iterative method for
Kademlia network database lookups that should be more reliable and efficient.
There are also several improvements to our SSU (UDP) transport protocol that
should help reliability and efficiency. We have made several changes to
improve tunnel build success rates. And, of course, there are lots of bug
fixes and translation updates.
</p><p>
The network has grown quite rapidly in recent weeks, and that's great news,
but it has caused some instability. We welcome all our new users and we
ask you to be patient as we make improvements to the software.
