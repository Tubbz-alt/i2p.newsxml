<h4><ul><li>2010-07-18: <b>I2P at HOPE, Cooperation with Pegasus Project</b></li></ul></h4>
<p>
A delegation of I2P developers and users has visited the <a
href="http://thenexthope.org/">HOPE hackers conference</a> in New York City
this weekend. Besides giving away cool stickers to Tor users, I2P project lead
zzz has participated in a talk given by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Hong">Adrian Hong</a> about Hackers
for Human Rights.
</p><p>
Adrian is director of the <a
href="http://www.tedafrica.org/fellows/view/id/22">Pegasus Project</a>, an
initiative that uses cutting-edge technology to penetrate closed societies and
empower people in those nations to communicate amongst  themselves, and with
the outside world.
</p><p>
I2P supports the efforts of those trying to build a more free society by
offering them an uncensorable, anonymous, and secure communication system. With
the aim to operate successfully in hostile environments, even when an
organization with substantial financial or political resources attacks it.
</p><p>
Since the goals of the Pegasus Project and I2P are so compatible, both projects
have agreed to cooperate in their creation of technology to help combat
oppressive forces, protect dissidents, journalists, and activists, and save
lives.
