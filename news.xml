New I2P version!
¡Bienvenidos hispanohablantes et bienvenue les français! I2P router console is now fully translated for our French and Spanish speaking friends.
The 0.8.5 release contains a few bug fixes and performance improvements, and lots of other translation updates.
Also, some security holes were closed and new limits established in order to prevent a DOS attack on the I2P network, as shown by a research project by TU Munich that dealt with I2P.
Tunnel building was modified not to create tunnels in the A-B-A or A-A-B peer order to prevent some basic attacks.
So you see, as usual, upgrading is worthwhile and recommended.
