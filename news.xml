    <h3>2013-01-10: <b><a title="Hackfest!!!!!!!" href="http://zzz.i2p/topics/1306">Syndie Hackfest</a> / Call for Testers</b></h3>
<p>
    We're a week into the &quot;Syndie Hackfest&quot; and there's been a great
    deal of progress! After years of drowning in the fetid swamp of neglect,
    our beloved Syndie is getting some much needed attention, resulting in many long
    standing bugs being fixed.
</p>
<p>You can join the fun by pulling the code from <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/monotone">Monotone</a> from the
    <code>i2p.syndie</code> branch, or by trying one of the new installers built by <a href="http://Killyourtv.i2p/syndie">kytv</a>.
    Coding, testing, or even just making comments or suggestions would be great help.
</p>
<h3>2013-01-10: <b>Unit Test Successes</b></h3>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of zab, zzz, and str4d the Junit tests are all
   passing for the first time in years&mdash;if ever!  Zab stuck with it until the
   very last test had been fixed. Thanks zab! And thank you to everyone that took
   part in reaching this milestone.
