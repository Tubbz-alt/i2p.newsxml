<div lang="en"><h3>2013-04-25: <b><a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/halloffame.html">funding on hold</a></b></h3>
<p>
Due to the closing down of <a href="http://bitcoin-24.com">Bitcoin 24.com</a> a amount of 7899&euro; is currently on hold and not reachable.
We put parts of our I2P general fund BTC into different exchange platforms for not being dependant on one of them and minimizing the risk of lost.
With the raising value of BTC the core team of I2P decided to exchange the BTC into &euro; to have these safe in our account, as the exchange rate of 
BTC was to volatile and looked like a big bulb.
These 7899&euro; are currently on hold and we need to wait until bitcoin 24 will release these money. Some chances are for total loss of this money.
Echelon will count this as a loss in the <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/halloffame.html">hall of fame</a> until the money does arrive on I2P account.

<p>A change was introduced during the 0.9.5 cycle to allow configuration files to be edited with the standard
   Windows text editor.  This change had the unfortunate side-effect of causing our eepsite migration code to
   fail to run on Windows systems. Only original installations of 0.9.5 on Windows are affected by this issue.

<p>Instructions for resolving this issue can be found on <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/ticket919">our website</a>.
