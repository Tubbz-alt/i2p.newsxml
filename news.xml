<h3>2011-05-07: <b>i2py-tahoe and over 3000 active nodes each day</b></h3>
<p>
A new implementation of tahoe-lafs arrived for I2P. <a href="http://i2py-tahoe.i2p">I2Py-tahoe</a> uses BOB, has active development and has setup a second grid. Currently this version is not compatible with ducks implementation of tahoe-lafs.
</p>
<p>
Latest <a href="http://stats.i2p/pix/total/routers2_1w.png">graph on stats.i2p</a> does show a estimated total active router count of 3000 hit at each day of last week. I2P is still growing.
</p>
<p>
New development version is available on <a href="http://echelon.i2p/0.8.5/0.8.5-2">echelons page</a>. It includes more tweaks against a powerful attacker.

New I2P version!
¡Bienvenidos hispanohablantes et bienvenue les français! I2P router console is now fully translated for our French and Spanish speaking friends.
The 0.8.5 release contains a few bug fixes and performance improvements, and lots of other translation updates.
Also, some security holes were closed and new limits established in order to prevent a DOS attack on the I2P network, as shown by a research project by TU Munich that dealt with I2P.
Tunnel building was modified not to create tunnels in the A-B-A or A-A-B peer order to prevent some basic attacks.
So you see, as usual, upgrading is worthwhile and recommended.
