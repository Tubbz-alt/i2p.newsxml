<h3>2012-12-29: <b>I2P on <a href="http://events.ccc.de/category/29c3/">29C3 in Hamburg, 2nd</a> and call for UCSB</b></h3>
<p>
We took part in a nice crypto party yesterday evening and showed I2P to a group of 40 people. Nice success.
I2P needs a banner, a flyer and handouts for interested users. We call out a contest for this material! The user who did the winning layout of each of this needed material gets 10 BTC and a T-shirt. Contact echelon@mail.i2p for your idea or more information!
</p>
<p>
If you are the researchers running the I2P hosts at the 192.35.222.1/24 subnet, please get in contact with us on IRC2p, on <a href="http://zzz.i2p">zzz.i2p</a> or with email.

<h3>2012-12-27: <b>I2P on <a href="http://events.ccc.de/category/29c3/">29C3 in Hamburg</a></b></h3>	
<p>

<h3>2012-12-17: <b>0.9.4 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.9.4.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>0.9.4 includes a fix for a network capacity bug, introduced in 0.9.2,
 that was reducing network performance and reliability. It also includes
 major changes in the in-network update system, and adds the capability
 to update via in-network torrents. </p>

<p>We fixed several bugs in the i2psnark DHT implementation that was introduced
 last release. For those of you using console or http proxy passwords,
 we converted to the more-secure digest method and improved the security for console forms.</p>

<p>For those of you already running development builds, your router should automatically
update to 0.9.4-0 using the new in-network torrent facility.
For those running 0.9.3-0, you will update normally using in-network HTTP, and
we will have more information for you when we release 0.9.5.</p>

<p>
As usual, there's also lots of bug fixes in this release, so updating is recommended.
