<h3>2012-02-06: <b>Net Status Update </b></h3>
<p>
Just a short update on current net status: yesterday we have had a new record day in lifetime of I2P. <a href="http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/total_routers_week.cgi">stats.i2p</a> did show a new high of over 14.000 active router, and echelons news.xml fetch count did show a number of over 12.000 unique news.xml fetches per day. Despite this high number the I2P behave very well and tunnel built success did not drop below 50 percent. I2P does grow and can cope very well with this growth. The fixes in <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.12.html">Version 0.8.12</a> did helped a lot.

<h3>2012-01-06: <b>0.8.12 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.12.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>
The 0.8.12 release fixes several serious message corruption bugs.
It also contains a redesign of the router's congestion control, and continued
optimization of CPU and memory usage. We are hopeful that these changes will
improve network performance. Upgrading is recommended.
