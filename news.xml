<h3>2014-02-10: <b><a href="http://echelon.i2p/docs/IRC2p/irc2p_userguide.txt">IRC2p Migration</a></b></h3>
<p>
After some work and weeks of preparation, the IRC2p team is ready to switch the operating servers to a new
setup and an upgraded IRCd/services. A new IRC server (irc.dg.i2p) is also joining the network!
The transition will occur on 2013-02-23 between 1:00PM UTC and 4:00PM UTC. During this time, the IRC2P will be
inaccessible and upgraded.
The new setup involves changes that may affect users. Read more about this migration on the
<a href="http://echelon.i2p/docs/IRC2p/irc2p_userguide.txt">IRC2p migration guide</a>.

<h3>2014-01-22: <b>0.9.10 <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/release-0.9.10.html">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
0.9.10 changes the mechanism for doing LeaseSet lookups, making it more difficult for an attacker
to correlate a Destination with a Router. It also fixes character encoding bugs in susimail,
and includes lots of other bug fixes and translation updates.
Most of you will update via torrent, using the new "su3" update format using stronger keys.
We recommend that all users update.

making several new connections and formulating <a href="http://zzz.i2p/">big plans</a> for 2014.
Thanks to those who supported our attendance with their <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/donate">donations</a>!
