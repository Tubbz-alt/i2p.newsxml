<h3>2013-02-04: <b><a title="Syndie 1.103b is now available" href="http://syndie-project.i2p">Syndie 1.103b is now available</a></b></h3>
<p>
    Thanks to the work of zzz and the help of many testers during the month-long
    "hackfest", we've got the first new Syndie release in nearly 6 years! Syndie 1.103b is now available
    for download from <a href="http://syndie-project.i2p/download.html">syndie-project.i2p</a>,
    <a href="http://syndie-project.org/download.html">syndie-project.org</a>, and the
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/~i2p-maintainers/+archive/i2p">I2P PPA</a>.
    Additionally, I2P-hosted torrents are <a href="http://tracker2.postman.i2p/index.php?view=TPoolDetail&amp;id=571">also available</a>
    If you wanted to try Syndie but were intimidated to build it yourself from source (or you previously tried
    it and you were frustrated by bugs) give this new version a try!

    <b>Note:</b> A full-time maintainer is still sought. Please get in touch if you can help!
