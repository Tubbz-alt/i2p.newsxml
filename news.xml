<h3>2013-09-20: <b>IPv6 bounty meshup with forthcoming I2P 0.9.8</b></h3>	

<p>I2P 0.9.8 will bring us IPv6 enabled by default, solving the I2P IPv6 bounty as solved. To celebrate 
this and promoting IPv6, we as I2P will provide the first 100 I2P router running on IPv6 native (no tunnels, 
no toredo, no IPv4/IPv6 translation) and being floodfill during the last 3 month (october till december)
of 2013 a 25 â‚¬ support. This special event starts with the release of I2P 0.9.8 (running IPv6 with 
previous releases will make you outstand of others). More information will be published on.....

<h3>2013-08-10: <b>0.9.7.1 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.9.7.1.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>This unscheduled release disables the RouterInfo verification messages that were used in the
<a href="http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~spjsschl/i2p.pdf">UCSB "practical attacks" paper</a>,
which should make correlating a LeaseSet and a Router much more difficult.
We have also included a limited number of other fixes listed below.
Our 0.9.8 release, which will include IPv6 support, is still on-schedule for late September.
As usual, we recommend that all users update to this release.
