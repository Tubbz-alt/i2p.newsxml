<h3>2014-02-18:	<b>Java 6 or Higher Required as of Release 0.9.12</b></h3>
<p>
This is our first increase in the minimum Java requirement since the I2P 0.6.5 release on Dec. 1, 2008.
Java 5 is very old and is unsupported by Oracle and most other suppliers.
If you are still running Java 5, please update to 6 or higher as soon as possible. Java 7 is strongly recommended for most platforms. For Raspberry Pi, we recommend Oracle Early Access 8.
</p>	
<h3>2014-02-08: <b>0.9.11 <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2014/02/08/0.9.11-Release">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
0.9.11 continues improving LeaseSet lookup and storage to prevent an attacker
from correlating a Destination with a Router.
It adds support for the <a href="http://www.subgraph.com/orchid.html">Orchid</a>
outproxy plugin which is available at <a href="http://plugins.i2p/plugins/orchid/">plugins.i2p</a>.
There is a reduction in memory usage due to fixes in the transports.
We have some I2CP protocol improvements that will provide better lookup facilities and
authorization protection for external clients.
Of course, there's also the usual collection of bug fixes.
All users should update.
</p><p>
This may be the last release that works with Java 5, which is very old and unsupported.
If you are using a Java 5 or 6 runtime, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to Java 7.

<h3>2014-02-07: <b><a href="http://echelon.i2p/docs/IRC2p/irc2p_userguide.txt">IRC2p Migration</a></b></h3>
<p>
After some work and weeks of preparation, the IRC2p team is ready to switch the operating servers to a new
setup and an upgraded IRCd/services. A new IRC server (irc.dg.i2p) is also joining the network!
The transition will occur on 2014-02-23 between 1:00PM UTC and 4:00PM UTC. During this time, the IRC2P will be
inaccessible and upgraded.
The new setup involves changes that may affect users. Read more about this migration on the
<a href="http://echelon.i2p/docs/IRC2p/irc2p_userguide.txt">IRC2p migration guide</a>.
