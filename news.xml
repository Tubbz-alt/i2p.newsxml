<h3>2011-10-17: Recent net growth and pledge to keep router running</h3>
<p>
Due to rusleaks's recent moving of their operations to I2P, we have been
experiencing a massive influx of many new routers, reaching a record of 12,000
active routers. This has caused the ride to be bumpy but it is nothing to be
concerned about.</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, growth is good for the network and good for your anonymity.
Not all eepsites are currently reachable on the first attempt but we hope that
will level out soon. So, if you are having problems accessing some services,
please be patient and don't leave straight away! Leave your I2P router
running, even when you're not actively using it &mdash; ideally your router
should be left running 24/7! This helps the network and it is beneficial to
your own anonymity. Take the time to ensure that you're not firewalled and that
your bandwidth settings have beeen configured for your system. By following
these simple steps performance will be improved for everyone.

In the meantime, perhaps you'd care to try out <a href="http://echelon.i2p/i2phex">I2Phex</a>,
<a href="http://echelon.i2p/imule">iMule</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2psnark/">I2Psnark</a>
to make use of the running I2P router?

<h3>2011-10-11: <b>0.8.9 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.9.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>
The 0.8.9 release has several performance improvements, and many changes to handle
the continued rapid growth of the network. It uses a new iterative method for
Kademlia network database lookups that should be more reliable and efficient.
There are also several improvements to our SSU (UDP) transport protocol that
should help reliability and efficiency. We have made several changes to
improve tunnel build success rates. And, of course, there are lots of bug
fixes and translation updates.
</p><p>
The network has grown quite rapidly in recent weeks, and that's great news,
but it has caused some instability. We welcome all our new users and we
ask you to be patient as we make improvements to the software.
