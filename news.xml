<p>A change was introduced during the 0.9.5 cycle to allow configuration files to be edited with the standard
   Windows text editor.  This change had the unfortunate side-effect of causing our eepsite migration code to
   fail to run on Windows systems. Only original installations of 0.9.5 on Windows are affected by this issue.
</p>
<p>Instructions for resolving this issue can be found on <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/ticket919">our website</a>.
